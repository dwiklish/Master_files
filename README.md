# The specifics of the files:
  * Run 25 - 33 are sine wave with a wave height input H = 0.075 m, T = 2, 1.43, 1.11 s.
  * Run 34 - 42 are sine wave with a wave height input H = 0.14 m, T = 1.11, 1.43, 2 s.
  * Run 43 - 51 are wave group with a wave height input H = 0.07 m, T = 1.11, 1.43, 2 s.
  * Run 42 - 60 are wave group with a wave height input H = 0.04 m, T = 1.11, 1.43, 2 s.
  * Run 97 - 105 are cnoidal wave with a wave height input H = 0.1 m, T = 1.55, 1.8, 2.5 s.
  * Run 106 - 117 are solitary wave.
  * Run 118 - 129 are N-wave.

To run the code, we need to change the path of the folder.

* Master_file1 contents the the data of sine and cnoidal wave.
* Master_file2 contents the the data of N-wave and solitary wave.
* Master_file3 contents the the data of wave group.

The wavemaker folder contains wavemaker codes for various wave shapes. In both the experiment and the simulation, the codes were used to generate waves. Furthermore, the figures folder includes the plot and figures used in the thesis.
