# The specifics of the files:
  * Run 25 - 33 are sine wave with a wave height input H = 0.075 m.
  * Run 34 - 42 are sine wave with a wave height input H = 0.14 m.
  * Run 43 - 51 are wave group with a wave height input H = 0.07 m.
  * Run 42 - 60 are wave group with a wave height input H = 0.04 m.
  * Run 97 - 105 are cnoidal wave with a wave height input H = 0.1 m.
  * Run 106 - 117 are solitary wave.
  * Run 118 - 129 are N-wave.

To run the code, we need to change the path of the folder.

* Master_file1 contents the the data of sine and cnoidal wave.
* Master_file2 contents the the data of N-wave and solitary wave.
* Master_file3 contents the the data of wave group.
